## Tech Stack

Our e-commerce application is built using a modern and robust tech stack:

1. **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
2. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating reusable UI components.
3. **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
4. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
5. **React Query**: A library for managing, caching, and syncing asynchronous and remote data in React.
6. **Lucide React**: A library of simply beautiful open source icons.
7. **Radix UI**: A low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience.
8. **Lodash**: A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.
9. **use-debounce**: A lightweight React hook for debouncing values.

## Planning & Initial Setup

1. Define project requirements and goals
2. Choose technology stack (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS)
3. Set up development environment
4. Create initial project structure

## Design Inspiration

1. Analyze Figma design for inspiration
2. Note key design elements and color schemes
3. Plan component structure based on design

## Frontend Implementation

1. Implement basic layout structure
2. Create reusable components:
   - Header
   - Footer
   - ProductCard
   - ProductGrid
   - Sidebar
   - SearchBar
3. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Backend Integration

1. Set up API routes for product data
2. Implement data fetching using React Query
3. Create custom hooks for data management:
   - useProducts
   - useCategories

## Feature Implementation

1. Implement product listing and grid view
2. Add category filtering functionality
3. Implement price range filter
4. Add sorting options for products
5. Implement pagination for product listings
6. Create search functionality with debounce

## Logic Implementation

1. Implement state management for filters and sorting
2. Add logic for updating product list based on filters
3. Implement search logic with API integration
4. Add error handling and loading states

## Optimization

1. Implement React.memo for component memoization
2. Use useMemo and useCallback hooks for performance optimization
3. Optimize image loading and implement lazy loading
4. Implement code splitting for better performance

## Finalization

1. Final review and testing
2. Documentation update
